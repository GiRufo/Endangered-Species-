	    <h3>Relatives?</h3>
		<p>The maned wolf, an animal closely resembling a fox, is neither a fox nor a 
		wolf, despite what the name implies. In fact, the maned wolf in not related to any
		other canids, the biological family of dogs. Because it has no close, 
		definite relations, it is the only species in genus <i><b>Chrysocyon.</i></b>
		The main thing that sets the Maned Wolf apart from a fox is its lack of <i>elliptical pupils</i>.</p>
	<br>    </br>
		<h3>Where is the Maned Wolf?</h3>
		<p>The manned wolf can typically be found in areas with a plethora of vegetation,
		typically in the grasslands of southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina,
		Bolivia, and far southeastern Peru, surrounded by bushes and trees. It is considered
		a &quot; vulnerable species &quot; due to loss of habitat in Uruguay, resulting in
		the displacement of this now rare mammal, though still considered &quot; lower
		risk &quot; by the IUCN, the <b><a href="https://www.iucn.org/about/">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a></b>
		</p>
	<br>    </br>
		<h3>What does it look like?</h3>
		<p>The Maned Wolf is the tallest of wild canids, with long legs thought to be 
		inherited from the tall grasslands of their habitat, and allowing them to stand, on average,
		at 35 inches. The average adult weighs 51 pounds, has an 18 inch long tail, and ears
		that are tall and long, typically 7 inches. Their fur can be many different hues
		from reddish brown to a golden orange. They have long black legs and a distinct 
		black mane. They are known for having a white tuft of hair at the tip of their tail 
		as well as a white patch, or &quot; bib &quot; underneath their throat. Maned Wolf 
		litters have from two to six black-furred pups that are fully grown by ten months
		and can take care of themselves by the end of their first year.</p>

		<h3>Habits and Notable Personalities</h3>
		<p>Unlike other canids, the maned wolf is known for not forming packs and feasting 
		on small animals. These large predators hunt alone between sundown and midnight 
		for prey such as rodents, hares, and birds. To locate their prey in the grass the 
		Maned Wolf rotates its large ears to listen carefully for any rustling. Once they
		hear their meal they tap the ground with their foot, making the other animal jump 
		from its hiding spot, and thus allowing for the Maned Wolf to grab it in its 
		mouth. While this way of getting food is violent and bloody, the Maned Wolf is 
		known for surprising researchers with the discovery that over 50% of the 
		Maned Wolf's diet is made of fruits like the Wolf Apple, a tomato-like food, 
		as well as vegetation, making the Maned Wolf an omnivorous creature.</p>
		<br>   </br>
		<h3>The Maned Wolf's Relationships with Humans</h3>
		<p>The Maned Wolf, though described in this page as being a hunter that attacks
		small animals, poses virtually no threat to humans. Though they have been know
		as &quot; chicken thieves &quot; for stealing chickens, cattle, and sheep from
		farms in this past, this has been proven false and we now know that when met by 
		humans this shy animal will typically flee upon being alarmed.</p>
		<br>   </br>
		
		<h3>Is the Maned Wolf in Danger?</h3> <img class="sevenimg" src="images/manedwolflocation.png" alt="wolf"/>
		<p>Historically, many Brazilian hunters tracked down the Maned Wolf for its eyes,
		thought to be good luck charms. Since its classification as a vulnerable species
		though, they are now protected by the Brazilian government. Habitat loss is still
		a threat, as well as the danger of the wolves being run over by cars. Illness 
		from domestic dogs, most notably infections by the giant kidney worm, are fatal, 
		and besides the spreading of this disease Maned Wolves have been known to be 
		attacked by both domestic and feral dogs. The <b><a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/visit">Smithsonian National Zoo Park</a></b>
		has been working to protect the wolves for nearly 3 decades by studying them in the
		wild, protecting their habitat, and educating people about them. Maned Wolves are
	    protected in many different areas including Cara√ßa and Emas, national parks in 
	    Brazil. They have been successfully bred in many zoos/captivity in Argentina, 
	    North America, and Europe.</p>
